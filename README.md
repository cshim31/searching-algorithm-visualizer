 <strong>This is open source path finding algorithm simulator using Python.</strong>
</p>

## Getting Started
### Building and installing
#### Prereqs:
- A Python compiler (Python 3.9.5+)
- A Pygame v2.0.1+ to enable support for graphic

<p> After downloading a source, Clone the repository.</p>
    
    git clone https://github.com/cshim31/Path-Finding-Visualizer.git
    
<p> Navigate to repository and run </p>    

    python main.py
    
## Features

### What does a checkmark mean?

</p>When an item is checkmarked, it means the implementation is complete. Uncheckmarked means implementation planned in future. 

- Supported algorithm :
  - [x] BFS
  - [x] DFS
  - [ ] Dijkstra's
  - [ ] Floyd-Warshall
  - [x] A* path finding  
 
### How to draw Wall 
</p>Supports wall painting on map. This affects algorithm simulation and generates different path based on shape of wall.
</p>Simply keep mouse left clicked and drag it.
